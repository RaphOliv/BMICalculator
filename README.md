# BMI Calculator
This project is a native Android application developed using the Kotlin programming language. Its main function is to calculate BMI and display the result on the next screen.

The BMI calculator was an application I developed to take my first steps with Android development. I took part in the 10D challenge in the DevSpace community and managed to get out of ZERO.
